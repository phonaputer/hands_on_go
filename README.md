# Hands-on-Go Workshop

Hands-on-Go is a workshop where attendees may write their first Go application from scratch. 
It is intended for people who know the basics of the Go language but would like to gain additional coding experience, learn about how to structure an application, etc.

## Pre-assignment

In order to join the workshop, you need to complete the pre-assignment by the required date (usually one week before the workshop's start).

The pre-assignment is just intended to ensure that you have learned the basics of Go.

For information on what the pre-assignment is, and how to complete and submit it, please look in the `pre_assignment` subdirectory.
The README there contains more information.

## User Application

The `user_application` directory is the working directory in which workshop attendees should write their code.
You'll learn more about what goes here during the workshop. 
But in short, you'll be writing an HTTP API server which handles CRUD operations on Users.
