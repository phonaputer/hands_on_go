# "Hands-on-Go" User Application

This is the directory in which you will write the code for the User Application you'll be developing in this workshop.

Please create a branch for your code using the following format: `${your_name}/${workshop_start_date_yyyyMM}`.

For example, for an attendee named Jane Doe who attended the September 2022 session, the branch name would be `jane.doe/202209`.

## Dependencies

The User Application uses the same Dockerized MySQL from the pre-assignment.
A Docker Compose file for this can be found in the `deployments/local` subdirectory of this directory.

## How to find the instructor's code

You can see the up-to-date code the instructor is writing in your workshop session by checking out the correct branch for your session.

The branch name will be in the following format: `instructor/${workshop_start_date_yyyyMM}`.

So for a workshop starting in September 2022, the branch would be `instructor/202209`.

Old instructor branches will not be deleted so you can check this anytime.
